This is a Nmap scanner I am building for the Information Security Certification @freeCodeCamp.org

I will try to use this README more as a diary to keep track of problems I run into, things I dont understand, and solutions I find.

1). I am using Visual Studio Code. It's saying "nmap" is not installed. Getting the following:
    
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nmap'
        used "python3 -m pip install python-nmap" in Visual Studio Code Terminal.
        Got answer on Stackoverflow at:
            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73927473/vs-code-is-not-recognizing-nmap/73942547#73942547

2.) The rest of the code went fairly well. Just a few punctuation errors. But I ran the program from command and in VS Code powershell and it worked great!.
